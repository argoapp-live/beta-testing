  <p align="center">
     Launching the Spheron Beta Testing Program to find bugs and vulnerabilities in our system and get some important feedback for the new web app.
  </p>
</p>


## How can I participate?

It's is open to everyone, you just have to raise an issue at https://github.com/argoapp-live/beta-testing using the bug report template. Tester must fill all the details in the bug report template to be eligible 

## When will I start finding the bugs?

The start of testing will be released by the team very soon.

## What will be the process of highlighting the bugs?

- Bug must be raised on GitHub by going to the issue, then create a new issue. 
- Choose the bug report template and fill all the detail properly.
- Please mark the <criticality> of the bug by labeling the issue with any of these low, high, critical
- For UI related issue, use `ui-bug` as label and for API related issue, use `api-bug` as label
- Must add criticality label for any issue raised - critical or high or low

## What will be the different criticality levels of the bugs?

There will be three types of bug that participants can find in the system:

- Critical: (bugs that can stop our entire system) - System Issue, Smart Contract Bug, Security Vulnerability, UI Crash, etc.
- High: (bugs that will not create any loss but improve the system) - Security Issues (but will not create that impact which critical can), System Issue (ex false data), Smart Contract Bug, UI issue (this will be bugs that will create a user confusion related to funds and other features)
- Low: (bugs that will not cause any big issue but itâ€™s good to have them rectified) - UI issues (ex formatting issues, component load issue, refresh issues), Security Issue
